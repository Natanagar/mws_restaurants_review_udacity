Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .

Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.


Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags

Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS

Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes

Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device

Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript functions).

//Service Worker
Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no other ServiceWorker features.

//made
If you would like to use Google Maps, there is a google-maps branch of the starter code. You'll need your own Google Maps API key. Replace the text YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in index.html and restaurant.html with your own key.
